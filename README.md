# Awesome ‘Vanilla’ Javascript [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A simple listing of *plain* — *[‘Vanilla’](http://vanilla-js.com/)* — Javascript resources.
Because sometimes you don't need a big library such as jQuery (which remains awesome IMO).

> **P.S.** ‘Vanilla’ JS is not *‘better’* than jQuery et. al! jQuery is a very good library. [It can be argued](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3393922) that many plugins and functions in the resources below are ‘worse’: less well documented, tested, less cross-browser compatibility, etc. However: sometimes a swiss-army knife monolith such as jQuery is too much. Tiny, reusable & modular modules FTW!

## Lists

Listing native methods, functions and plugins

### [plainjs.com](https://plainjs.com/)

Vanilla *Plugins* and *Functions*

In addition to [youmightnotneedjquery.com](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) this is a list of commonly used plugins without dependencies.

###  [The Vanilla JavaScript Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com)

A growing collection of [code snippets](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/code-snippets), [helper functions](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/helpers), [polyfills](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills), [plugins](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/plugins), and [learning resources](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/resources), by [Chris&nbsp;Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/).

### [Frend.co](https://frend.co/)

Modest and dependency-free components. Built with web standards, compliant, keyboard navigable and properly interpreted by assistive technologies.

### [Microjs.com](http://microjs.com/)

### [140byt.es](http://www.140byt.es/)

A collection of *heavily minified* JS snippets. **Note:** These are more of a *coding challenge* and probably not the best resource for *production* code! Inspirational, sure!

### [HTML5 Cross Browser Polyfills](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills)

Not ‘Vanilla’ per se, but a neat list of HTML5 cross-browser polyfills, by the folks from [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)

### Search [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Github](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&o=desc&q=vanilla&s=&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93) or [Google](https://www.google.com/?q=Vanilla+JS+%3Cplugin%3E)

Don't forget to search NPM when you ‘`require`’ a specific JS module! Looking for a ‘Vanilla-version’ of a plugin? Try searching Google or Github directly :)

Articles on moving away from jQuery towards native Javascript

### [“Ditching jQuery for Vanilla JS”](http://gomakethings.com/ditching-jquery)

Awesome write-up by [Chris Ferdinandi](http://gomakethings.com/) of how he goes about writing vanilla JS. Full of tips and Vanilla equivalents of jQuery functions

### [“Essentials to learning JavaScript from a jQuery background”](http://toddmotto.com/is-it-time-to-drop-jquery-essentials-to-learning-javascript-from-a-jquery-background/)

[Todd Motto](http://toddmotto.com/) describes many native equivalents of jQuery methods and functions

### [“Uncovering the Native DOM API”](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/uncovering-the-native-dom-api)

[Nicolas Bevacqua](http://ponyfoo.com/) ([@nzgb](https://twitter.com/nzgb)) covering the DOM API that libraries such as jQuery often ‘abstract away’ in their neat util functions.

### [“Getting over jQuery”](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/getting-over-jquery)

Nicolas Bevacqua again. This time outlining how we could go about creating our own little ‘microlibrary’

### [“weaning yourself off jquery”](http://substack.net/weaning_yourself_off_jquery)

James Halliday ([substack](https://github.com/substack)) points out how a big dependancy like jQuery can make “a tiny frontend module much bigger and more cumbersome than it needs to be.” and is therefore “unattractive” in an ecosystem of “tiny reusable components.”

### [“The Basics of DOM Manipulation in Vanilla JavaScript”](https://www.sitepoint.com/dom-manipulation-vanilla-javascript-no-jquery/)

Sebastian Seitz gives you a crash course in DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript, abstracting the more verbose parts into a set of helper functions.
